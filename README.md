# GoWebapp
Go Getting Started from PluralSight. Simple webapp in golang

## This is simple Webapp in GO, which has users api to interact with backend 

This hosts the app in **3000** port, (please change in main.go if the port is not available)

### To run the App (from source directory): 
`go run main.go`

This will start the server and then you can use localhost for requests. 

Added postman collections to help you test the CRUD calls since there is no UI Form.

To run Postman collections 
1. Create the environment variable `userId` 
2. Import collections from JSON file
3. It will import all tests and you can use it to run the REST APIs
